        'introduction': 'Chicken Adobo is an authentic Filipino dish and is one of the mostly recognized Filipino foods. Not to be mistaken with Mexican adobo, this dish is uniquely prepared by stewing chicken in vinegar and soy sauce.',
        'preparation': 'Cooking Chicken Adobo is quick and simple. This recipe suggests marinating the chicken to make it more flavorful. It is the best way to go if you want to experience authentic Filipino chicken adobo. If you are in a hurry, feel free to skip this step, but make sure to simmer the chicken longer than 30 minutes to better extract the flavors from it. Start by marinating the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how flavorful you want the dish to be. Sometimes marinating for an hour is not enough. I think that 3 hours is optimal. The chicken absorbs most of the flavors from the soy sauce and garlic during this step. It is noticeable when you taste the dish after cooking. Note that it is also possible to include the vinegar in this step. The next step is to separate the chicken from the marinade. Make sure to set the marinade aside because it will be used later on. Pan-fry the chicken pieces for 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side. This will partially cook the outer part. It also makes the skin tough enough to withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which is nice for presentation. Pour marinade into the pot and add water. Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. The process takes 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quality of the chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in low heat for a super tender chicken adobo. Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add sugar and salt. I only add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings. Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce. If you like it very tasty then continue to cook on an uncovered cooking pot until the liquid completely evaporates.'

        'introduction': 'Kare Kare is a traditional Filipino stew complimented with a thick savory peanut sauce. The commonly used meats for this dish are ox tail, tripe, and pork leg; on some occasions goat and chicken meat are also used. Besides the peanuts, this dish depends on the shrimp paste (on the side) in order to be fully enjoyed. Traditionally, “palayok” (clay cooking pot) is used to cook this dish and it is also used as the serving pot.',
        'preparation': 'Let’s talk about how I cooked the version in this recipe post. There are three main processes: tenderize the meat, make the sauce, and prepare the vegetables. Prepare the meat by boiling it along with chopped onion. This will make it tender while providing flavor at the same time. Oxtail needs to be very tender for best results. It takes around 3 hours to boil when cooking using the traditional method. A quicker way is to use a pressure cooker. It cuts the cooking time by more than half. The peanut sauce can make or break your dish. It is important to have the proper ratio of ingredients to be able to achieve the ideal consistency of the sauce. It should not be too thick or very thin. I use both peanut butter and crushed peanuts to make the sauce. It provides a rich flavor to it. Annatto seeds make the color of the sauce reddish. You will need to extract the color from the seed by soaking it in warm water for around 12 minutes. The colored water is used to make the dish, not the seed. Discard the seed after use. Thicken the sauce with toasted ground rice. Vegetable is an important component of kare kare. It can be cooked with the meat or it can be added when serving the dish. I opted to cook the vegetables separately by sautéing with garlic.'

        'name': 'Balbacua',
        'image_url': 'https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/balbacua.jpg',
        'introduction': 'This recipe is sure to get the attention of many readers over in Visayas and Mindanao. Balbacua is a delightful Filipino dish that is most popular in those areas of the Philippines. And so if you are not familiar with this, just imagine a warm, truly delicious mix of Pochero and Kare Kare. Our savory Balbacua also has a bit of a milder flavor that is not too salty, but counts on the richness of the tomato sauce to give it depth.',
        'preparation': 'We’re starting with this step to really get the flavors going from our garlic, ginger and onion. Put 3 tablespoons of cooking oil in a pan, and let this get hot. Take the onion you’ve chopped, 2 knobs of ginger you’ve crushed, and 5 cloves of garlic you’ve crushed, and sauté these together. You can set this aside once the onion softens. Place 5 lbs. of cow trotters, 10 cups of water, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper, and 1 bunch of lemongrass with the white part cut in 4-inch pieces in a cooking pot. Apply heat, and let the mixture boil. Then set the heat to the lowest available setting. Let this simmer for 3 hours, or until the meat and the fibers on the trotters become tender. Take the lemongrass out of the pot. Then sprinkle in 2 teaspoons of annatto powder, and sauteed aromatics, otherwise known as the onion, garlic and ginger you sautéed earlier. Also add 3 tablespoons of salted black beans, and 1 Knorr Beef Cube. Cook this up for 30 minutes. Then you can incorporate 3 Jalapeno peppers, 1 bell pepper you’ve sliced, and 1 bunch of green onions you cut into 2-inch pieces. Continue cooking the mixture for 10 minutes more. Then just add as much fish sauce as you like. If you are not too keen on the flavor of this, you could substitute the patis with salt. Then just put everything into a serving bowl. Eat all of this up while it is irresistibly hot! And then you’re done with your very own Balbacua.'

        'image_url': 'https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/garlic-pepper-beef-jpg.webp',
        'introduction': 'Buttery and filled with lots of savory flavors, Garlic Pepper Beef makes for a great lunch or dinner. And for a recipe that is not exactly Filipino in origin, it may shock you just how popular this is among our kababayans. A popular fast food chain is known for its adaptation of the delicious dish, and has made several comebacks to please customers. But where exactly does the appeal come from? What makes Garlic Pepper Beef so universally loved?',
        'preparation': 'For this, you just need to put your beef sirloin, soy sauce, oyster sauce, ground black pepper, garlic powder and cornstarch in a container. Now mix these together, and make sure that the beef is nicely covered by the marinade. Wait for 10 minutes to let the flavor soak into the meat. While waiting, we can go ahead, and heat up some oil in our pan. And then put the minced garlic inside for cooking in low heat. Making sure that this does not get burnt, you can keep cooking until you have a golden brown color for the garlic. Then use a kitchen strainer to filter your garlic with a container below to catch the oil. Set this aside, along with the oil that we have gathered as we will use this later. Once the marinating time is up, it’s off to frying! Pour your garlic oil in the pan we used earlier, and let this get hot. Then put your marinated beef inside, and fry this until the beef is brown. Take the beef out of the pan for now. And then add butter to the pan, and just melt this. Put half of your Knorr beef cube. Now we have to place the beef back inside, and stir-fry everything for a good 30 seconds.'
